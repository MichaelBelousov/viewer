# iTwin Viewer for Web

The iTwin Web Viewer is a configurable iModel.js viewer that offers basic tooling and widgets out-of-the-box and can be further extended through the use of [iModel.js extensions](https://github.com/imodeljs/extension-sample) and/or [UI Providers](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/ui/augmentingui/). This package should be used for web-based applications. For desktop applications, use [@itwin/desktop-viewer-react](https://github.com/itwin/viewer/tree/main/packages/modules/desktop-viewer-react).

# Development

When making changes to the src, run `npm start` in the package's root folder to enable source watching and rebuild, so the dev-server will have access to updated code on succesful code compilation.
